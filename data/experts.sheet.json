    "comment": "Other than a Sept. 23 trip to Colorado, which is rematch of last year's Pac-12 title game, Washington isn't expected to face much resistance in the first half of the season. The Huskies are loaded with veteran stars at nearly every position, including  junior quarterback Jake Browning, a Heisman Trophy finalist last year, and senior linebacker Azeem Victor, a preseason All-American. Last season's run to the CFP semifinals was an unexpected surprise, but in reality fourth-year coach Chris Petersen built the roster expecting a return to national prominence in 2017.\n",

    "comment": "Despite substantial departures, the Huskies are loaded once again and poised to romp through their Pac-12 schedule. Stanford will be highly motivated to avenge last year’s 44-6 loss, and the fact the game will be played on The Farm makes it the most likely source of a blemish. A potential Pac-12 title matchup with USC looms as the potential game of the year not just in the conference, but in college football.",

    "comment": "Until proven otherwise, I have no reason to doubt Chris Petersen. The Huskies have lost big-name talent before and recovered just fine. I imagine they will do so again this season, and though Stanford on the road will be a significant test, UW should prevail to reach their second straight Pac-12 championship game. But that's where things will get dicey. By the end of the season last year, USC was the the best team in the conference and will be even better this year. Don't count on UW getting back to the playoffs despite having just one loss.",

But if not, the Huskies will be stuffed with creampuffs by the time the Pac-12 title game arrives. A very good team blitzing through a very soft schedule.",
